Before jumping into the why and how, here's what we achieved:

- ‚úÖ Replaced a single point of failure with AWS-native components

- üí∏ Reduced monthly costs by 70%

- üßë‚Äçüíª No more SSH, servers, or NGINX restarts

- üîê Fully managed SSL with ACM

- üõ†Ô∏è Everything codified and versioned via Terraform

{{< alert type="success" >}}
All of this ‚Äî without a single EC2 server or NGINX config file.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< vs 3 >}}

## Why we left EC2 + NGINX behind (and how much it saved us)
{{< vs 1 >}}
We had a simple goal: redirect traffic for over **70 different domains**.  
At first, we solved it with what we knew ‚Äî an **EC2 instance running NGINX** with hardcoded `301` and `302` rules. It worked‚Ä¶ until it didn‚Äôt.

{{< vs 3 >}}

What started as a quick fix became an operational headache:

- Any new redirect meant SSH access and manual file editing  
- Restarting NGINX came with downtime risks  
- A single typo could break everything  
- Most importantly: we were maintaining a full server just to handle redirects

{{< vs 2 >}}

Eventually, we asked ourselves: _isn‚Äôt this just a glorified spreadsheet with SSL and uptime issues?_  
That question led us to redesign the whole setup using **ALB, Terraform, ACM**, and nothing else.

And it worked ‚Äî spectacularly.

That‚Äôs a **~70% reduction**, with zero servers to maintain and full scalability.

## üõ† The New Setup: ALB + Terraform + SSL + Logs

Once we made the switch, we wanted the entire solution to be automated, secure, and easy to maintain. Here‚Äôs what we built:

{{< vs 4 >}}

### üìä Visual Overview: How the Flow Works

Sometimes it's easier to understand this type of infrastructure visually. Here's a high-level diagram that shows how user requests travel through Route 53, the ALB, and how redirect behavior is handled:

{{< vs 2 >}}

{{< img src="/posts/aws/aws-networking/images/diagram-redirect-alb.png" align="center" title="How Route 53 and ALB process incoming requests" >}}

{{< vs 2 >}}

This shows:  
- What happens when someone accesses a random or known domain  
- How Route 53 routes requests to the ALB  
- The difference between traffic arriving on port 80 and port 443  
- What the ALB does when no matching redirect rule is found (default 404)

{{< vs 4 >}}

### üîß Components Used

- **ALB (Application Load Balancer)**: Handles all HTTP/HTTPS requests  
- **Redirect Listener Rules**: Define what gets redirected and where  
- **Route 53**: Hosted Zones already managed all our domain DNS  
- **AWS ACM**: For issuing and auto-renewing SSL certificates  
- **Access Logs**: Enabled and pushed to S3 for auditing  
- **Terraform**: Used to define everything as code  
- **Modules**: We used Anton Babenko‚Äôs modules for [`alb`](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-alb) and [`acm`](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-acm)

{{< vs 4 >}}

### üîê Managing SSL Certificates with ACM

We used **ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)** to request certificates per domain, with auto-renewal enabled. Since we had all domains in Route 53, validation was done automatically via DNS ‚Äî no manual setup needed.

{{< vs 2 >}}

Code:

```hcl
module "acm" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/acm/aws"
  version = "~> 4.0"

  domain_name               = "example.com"
  subject_alternative_names = ["www.example.com"]
  zone_id                  = data.aws_route53_zone.main.zone_id
  validate_certificate     = true
}
```

{{< vs 4 >}}
### üåê ALB Listener Rules + Redirects
We implemented two listeners:

- Port `80` (HTTP): Redirects everything to HTTPS

- Port `443` (HTTPS): Processes redirect rules (up to 100 max), default action is `404`
{{< vs 2 >}}

Code:
```hcl
module "redirect_alb" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/alb/aws"
  version = "9.12.0"

  name               = "redirect-alb"
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  internal           = false

  vpc_id  = aws_vpc.main.id
  subnets = [aws_subnet.public_a.id, aws_subnet.public_b.id]

  access_logs = {
    bucket  = aws_s3_bucket.alb_logs.bucket
    enabled = true
    prefix  = "alb-access"
  }

  create_security_group = true
  security_group_ingress_rules = {
    http = {
      from_port   = 80
      to_port     = 80
      ip_protocol = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }
    https = {
      from_port   = 443
      to_port     = 443
      ip_protocol = "tcp"
      cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }
  }

  http_listeners = [
    {
      port     = 80
      protocol = "HTTP"
      action = {
        type     = "redirect"
        redirect = {
          port        = "443"
          protocol    = "HTTPS"
          status_code = "HTTP_301"
        }
      }
    }
  ]

  https_listeners = [
    {
      port            = 443
      protocol        = "HTTPS"
      certificate_arn = module.acm.certificate_arn
      rules = [
        {
          priority = 10
          actions = [{
            type = "redirect"
            redirect = {
              host        = "www.example.com"
              status_code = "HTTP_301"
              protocol    = "HTTPS"
            }
          }]
          conditions = [{
            host_header = {
              values = ["old-domain.com"]
            }
          }]
        },
        {
          priority = 20
          actions = [{
            type = "redirect"
            redirect = {
              host        = "www.blog.example.com"
              path        = "/blog"
              status_code = "HTTP_301"
              protocol    = "HTTPS"
            }
          }]
          conditions = [{
            host_header = {
              values = ["legacy-blog.net"]
            }
          }]
        }
      ]

      default_action = {
        type = "fixed-response"
        fixed_response = {
          content_type = "text/plain"
          message_body = "Not Found"
          status_code  = "404"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### ‚ú® Why This Worked for Us
{{< vs 2 >}}
‚úÖ Fully serverless ‚Äî no EC2 to maintain

‚úÖ ~70% cost savings

‚úÖ All redirects are version-controlled in Terraform

‚úÖ SSL certificates managed automatically (with renewals) via ACM

‚úÖ Access logs enabled for auditing

‚úÖ Default rule returns 404 to avoid exposing internal details

‚úÖ Port 80 cleanly redirects to HTTPS (443)

‚úÖ Ready to integrate with WAF or CloudWatch in the future

‚úÖ Everything is Infrastructure-as-Code, ready for CI/CD pipelines


{{< vs 3 >}}

### ‚ùå What We Didn't Use (And Why)
{{< vs 2 >}}
- **Lambda@Edge** ‚Äì great for complex logic at scale, but overkill for simple 301s.  
- **CloudFront Functions** ‚Äì less Terraform support, more limits.  
- **S3 Static Hosting** ‚Äì no built-in SSL unless fronted by CloudFront.  

_In the end, simplicity won. ALB covered 100% of our use case ‚Äî no Lambda, no CloudFront needed._


{{< vs 3 >}}
## üìå Scaling Tip 
> AWS ALB supports up to **100 listener rules per listener**.  
>  
> If you need more, consider:  
> ‚Ä¢ üß© Use multiple listeners (e.g., different ports or multiple ALBs)  
> ‚Ä¢ üöÄ Move to CloudFront Functions or Lambda@Edge for large-scale redirects  
> ‚Ä¢ üóÇÔ∏è Group redirects using wildcard domains or path patterns  

{{< vs 1 >}}  
_Plan your redirect strategy early to avoid scaling bottlenecks later._

{{< vs 4 >}}

## üí° Lessons Learned

- Keep infrastructure as simple as the problem requires ‚Äî NGINX was overkill for redirects.  
- ALB rules are powerful, but don‚Äôt scale infinitely. Plan limits early.  
- Terraform made experimentation and rollback safe and auditable.  
- Relying on managed services like ACM for SSL removed 90% of the ops burden.

_In short, we turned a fragile EC2 setup into a robust serverless system ‚Äî saving money, effort, and future headaches._
